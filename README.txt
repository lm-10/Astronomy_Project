The above code contains some calculations for getting the values of mass, velocity,
schwarzchild radius, event horizon(area), time, force of gravity and temperature for
a system of Black Hole and a star(SO*2) orbiting the black hole.
The calculations can also be used for a system of two bodies, with one being in the
center and the other orbiting it.
